# MouseDetector - an example App which is able to check where the mouse pointer is currently at!

If you are ever going to develop a game or whatever for Android or with Android support, then please take a look at this and maybe implement fancy mouse controls to look around! Not like these one's at Minecraft PE where you need to hold that cursor to be able to look around. I attached a demo Video and yes at some places it returns 0 true but you could fix it with storing last cursor position and and and. Also the second shows that with the removed action bar it even works better! Hope it helps, if you ever done a cool app make sure to notify me for example by opening an issue. :)

# Sorry for the lame ZIP and MP4's by the way and on the recordings the android mouse is hidden because the Samsung Game Launcher Screen recorder filtered it out but that does not matter because it still works very fine!
