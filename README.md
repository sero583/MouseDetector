# MouseDetector - a demonstration App which is able to check where the mouse pointer is currently at!

If you are ever going to develop something for Android with mouse support, then this may be useful to you.

# Sorry for the lame MP4's. Also during the recordings the android mouse is hidden because the the screen recorder filtered it out. That does not matter though, because it still works fine.
